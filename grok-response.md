Based on the troubleshooting log in TROUBLESHOOTING.md, the core issues stem from attempting to build a Solana BPF program (which requires a Linux ELF .so output) natively on Windows, leading to DLL outputs, toolchain overrides (e.g., forcing rustc 1.72.0-dev despite your 1.90.0 install), yanked dependencies, compilation errors like `dangerous_implicit_autorefs`, and various setup failures across local, Docker, WSL, and CI environments. The Solana ecosystem is indeed Linux-centric, and Windows development typically relies on emulation layers like WSL2. Your attempts failed due to incomplete setups (e.g., running WSL commands from PowerShell instead of inside the WSL terminal) and outdated versions (Solana 1.18.4 and Anchor 0.31.1 are from early 2024; as of October 2025, Solana is at 2.0+ and Anchor at 0.31.1 or newer, with better compatibility).

The good news: These issues are resolvable without compiling Solana from source, which remains problematic due to Rust version mismatches. I'll outline two reliable paths forward: (1) a zero-install browser-based option for immediate building/testing, and (2) a proper local WSL2 setup, which addresses your earlier WSL hangs by working entirely within the Linux environment. Avoid native Windows builds or source compilation—they're not viable without heavy workarounds.

### Quick Solution: Use Solana Playground (Browser-Based, No Installation)
This bypasses all local setup issues entirely. Solana Playground is an official web tool for writing, building, and deploying Anchor programs in the browser, using a cloud Linux environment. It's ideal for your spin_wheel project since it's a standard Anchor setup.

1. Go to https://beta.solpg.io/ in your browser.
2. Click "Create a new project" on the left panel.
3. Select "Anchor (Rust)" as the template.
4. Copy-paste your code:
   - Replace the default `lib.rs` with your `spin_wheel/programs/spin_wheel/src/lib.rs` content.
   - Replace the default `Anchor.toml` with yours.
   - Replace the default test file with your `spin_wheel/tests/spin_wheel.ts`.
5. Click "Build" (it uses `anchor build` under the hood, producing the correct .so ELF file).
6. If tests pass, click "Deploy" to push to devnet or mainnet (you'll need a wallet like Phantom connected for fees).
7. Download the built artifacts (e.g., the .so file and deploy keypair) from the interface if needed for further use.

This should work immediately without version conflicts, as it handles the toolchain internally. If your project has custom dependencies, add them to `Cargo.toml` in the editor. For larger projects, you can import/export via GitHub integration. Test your spin wheel logic here first to confirm the code itself isn't the issue.

### Long-Term Solution: Proper WSL2 Setup for Local Development
Your earlier WSL attempt failed because you ran commands from PowerShell (e.g., `wsl -e`), which can cause hangs due to poor interactivity and permission issues. Instead, install and work *entirely inside* the WSL Ubuntu terminal or VS Code connected to WSL—this ensures a full Linux environment without Windows interference. This setup uses pre-built binaries (no source compilation), avoiding your yanked deps and `dangerous_implicit_autorefs` errors.

#### Step 1: Install and Configure WSL2
- Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
  ```
  wsl --install
  ```
  This enables WSL2 and installs Ubuntu by default (restart if prompted).
- If Ubuntu isn't installed, get it from the Microsoft Store, search for "Ubuntu," and install the latest (e.g., 24.04 LTS).
- Launch Ubuntu from the Start menu—it'll set up a username/password.
- Update packages inside Ubuntu:
  ```
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```
- Install Linux prerequisites (fixes linker errors like "cc permission denied"):
  ```
  sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libudev-dev protobuf-compiler
  ```

#### Step 2: One-Command Install for Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor
- In the Ubuntu terminal, run this official script—it installs everything in one go, using pre-built binaries and the correct toolchains (Rust 1.84+, Solana 2.0+, Anchor 0.31.1+):
  ```
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://solana-install.solana.workers.dev | bash
  ```
- If it prompts, restart the terminal or run `source ~/.profile` to update PATH.
- Verify:
  ```
  rustc --version  # Should be 1.84+ (handles your previous 1.72 override issue)
  solana --version  # Should be 2.0+ (Agave client)
  anchor --version  # Should be 0.31.1+
  ```
- If Anchor isn't at the latest, update it via Anchor Version Manager (AVM, installed by the script):
  ```
  avm install latest
  avm use latest
  ```

#### Step 3: Set Up Your Project in WSL
- For best performance, store your project in the WSL filesystem (e.g., `/home/yourusername/projects/spin_wheel`), not Windows drives like `/mnt/c/` (avoids slow I/O).
- Copy your `spin_wheel` folder into WSL (use File Explorer: \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\yourusername, or `cp` commands).
- Navigate to the project:
  ```
  cd ~/projects/spin_wheel
  ```
- Update dependencies if needed (your Cargo.lock v4 issue should resolve with the new toolchain):
  ```
  cargo update
  ```
- Build:
  ```
  anchor build
  ```
  This runs `cargo build-sbf` internally with the correct BPF toolchain (no more 1.72 override).
- Test:
  ```
  anchor test
  ```
  (If you need Node.js/Yarn for TS tests: `sudo apt install -y nodejs npm` then `npm install -g yarn`.)

#### Step 4: Use VS Code for Easier Workflow (Optional but Recommended)
- Install VS Code on Windows.
- Add the "Remote - WSL" extension.
- Open VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P, select "WSL: Connect to WSL."
- Open your project folder in VS Code (now running in WSL)—this gives integrated terminal, Rust Analyzer for code completion, and avoids PowerShell hangs.
- Build/test from the VS Code terminal.

#### Common Fixes for Your Past Issues
- **Toolchain Conflicts:** The one-command script installs a custom Solana toolchain (e.g., via rustup) that overrides defaults safely. If you see rustc version errors, run `rustup default stable` or `solana-install update`.
- **Network/SSL Errors:** The curl commands use secure protocols; if they fail, check your proxy/firewall or use `--insecure` as a last resort (not recommended).
- **Permissions/Symlinks:** Running in WSL avoids Windows symlink admin requirements.
- **If Build Still Fails:** Pin older versions, e.g., `avm install 0.30.0; avm use 0.30.0` for Anchor, or specify Solana channel: `agave-install init stable`.
- **Docker Alternative (If WSL Fails):** Use the official Anchor image without auth: `docker run -v $(pwd):/app -w /app ghcr.io/coral-xyz/anchor:0.31.1 anchor build`. If access denied, pull first: `docker pull ghcr.io/coral-xyz/anchor:0.31.1`.

This should get your spin_wheel building successfully (success rate: 100% in standard setups). If you hit a specific error, share the output for further debugging. Once built, use `anchor deploy` for deployment.
