# WOLF-SPIN Troubleshooting Log

## Problem Summary
We need to build a Solana program (spin wheel DApp) on Windows, but Solana programs require Linux ELF format (`.so` files) while Windows produces DLL format (`.dll` files).

## What We've Tried and Why It Failed

### 1. Local Installation Approach
**What we tried:** Installing Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor locally in the project folder
**Why it failed:** 
- Windows/bash incompatibility issues
- Network issues with `Invoke-WebRequest`
- PowerShell script encoding/parsing errors

### 2. Global Installation Approach
**What we tried:** Installing Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor globally
**Why it failed:**
- `cargo build-sbf` command not available (Solana toolchain not properly installed)
- `anchor build` produces Windows DLL instead of Linux ELF
- Solana CLI doesn't have a direct build command

### 3. Docker Approach
**What we tried:** Using Docker to build in Linux environment
**Why it failed:**
- First attempt: Custom Dockerfile with manual Solana installation failed due to network issues
- Second attempt: Using pre-built Anchor Docker image failed due to authentication requirements
- Third attempt: Using rust:1.90.0-slim with manual installation failed due to `cargo build-sbf` not available

### 4. WSL2 Approach
**What we tried:** Using WSL2 Ubuntu to build in Linux environment
**Why it failed:**
- WSL commands hanging when trying to execute from PowerShell
- Interactive sessions not returning properly
- Couldn't establish proper communication with WSL environment

### 5. Cargo Installation from Source
**What we tried:** Installing Solana CLI and tools via `cargo install --git`
**Why it failed:**
- Yanked dependencies (`solana_rbpf = "=0.8.0"` is yanked)
- Compilation errors due to missing dependencies
- Version conflicts between different Solana packages

### 6. Pre-built Binary Installation
**What we tried:** Downloading and running Solana installer executable
**Why it failed:**
- Symlink creation requires administrator privileges
- Windows permission issues with creating symlinks
- Installer expects specific directory structure

### 7. Toolchain Version Conflicts
**What we tried:** Using `cargo build-sbf` and `anchor build` with pre-built binaries
**Why it failed:**
- `cargo build-sbf` forces use of rustc 1.72.0-dev instead of installed 1.90.0
- `anchor build` has same toolchain override issue
- `Xargo.toml` file causes toolchain conflicts
- Cargo.lock version 4 incompatibility with current Cargo version
- Even `cargo +stable build-sbf` doesn't work due to internal toolchain override

### 8. GitHub Actions Build Attempts
**What we tried:** Using GitHub Actions to build in Linux environment
**Why it failed:**
- First attempt: Used deprecated `actions-rs/install` with network errors
- Second attempt: Direct Solana CLI installation failed with SSL connection errors
- Third attempt: `rustup toolchain install solana` failed with "invalid toolchain name"
- Fourth attempt: `cargo install` from Solana source failed with compilation errors
- Fifth attempt: Docker approach failed due to missing `wget` command
- Sixth attempt: Docker with Solana toolchain failed with same `dangerous_implicit_autorefs` compilation error
- Seventh attempt: Downloaded Solana binaries directly from GitHub releases - 404 Not Found error
- Eighth attempt: Used `curl --insecure` to bypass SSL issues - still got TLS connection errors
- Ninth attempt: Used pre-built Anchor Docker image `ghcr.io/coral-xyz/anchor:0.31.1` - denied access (authentication required)
- **Root cause:** Solana source code doesn't compile with latest Rust compiler due to `dangerous_implicit_autorefs` error
- **Additional issues:** SSL/TLS connection problems, missing GitHub release URLs, Docker image authentication requirements

## Current Status
- ✅ Rust 1.90.0 installed and working
- ✅ Solana CLI 1.18.4 installed and working (from pre-built binaries)
- ✅ Anchor CLI 0.31.1 installed and working
- ✅ Program compiles successfully on Windows (produces DLL)
- ❌ `cargo build-sbf` fails with toolchain version conflicts (rustc 1.72.0-dev vs 1.90.0)
- ❌ `anchor build` fails with same toolchain version conflicts
- ❌ `Xargo.toml` file causes toolchain override issues
- ❌ Cargo.lock version 4 incompatibility with current Cargo version
- ❌ GitHub Actions builds fail due to Solana source compilation errors
- ❌ Docker approaches fail due to same compilation issues
- ❌ SSL/TLS connection errors prevent Solana installation in CI/CD
- ❌ GitHub release URLs for Solana binaries are incorrect/404
- ❌ Pre-built Docker images require authentication (denied access)
- ❌ All approaches ultimately fail due to fundamental toolchain incompatibilities

## Next Steps to Try

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Solana Docker Image
- Find a working Docker image with Solana toolchain pre-installed
- Use `docker run` with the pre-built image
- Avoid compilation issues by using tested environment

### Option 2: Use Older Rust Version in Docker
- Use `rust:1.75.0-slim` instead of `rust:1.90.0-slim`
- Older Rust version might be compatible with Solana source
- Install Solana toolchain with older Rust

### Option 3: Use Online Solana Development Environment
- Use Gitpod, CodeSandbox, or similar with Solana tooling
- Build in cloud Linux environment
- Avoid local compilation issues entirely

### Option 4: Proper WSL2 Setup
- Manually set up WSL2 with Ubuntu
- Install Solana toolchain inside WSL2
- Build from within WSL2 environment

### Option 5: Use Different Solana Version
- Try older Solana version (v1.17.x or v1.16.x)
- Older versions might be compatible with current Rust
- Use `--locked` flag with specific version

## Key Learnings
1. Solana programs MUST be built for Linux ELF format, not Windows DLL
2. The `cargo build-sbf` command is essential for Solana program building
3. Yanked dependencies in the Solana ecosystem cause compilation failures
4. Windows symlink permissions can block installer execution
5. WSL2 communication from PowerShell can be problematic
6. **Solana source code doesn't compile with latest Rust compiler** due to `dangerous_implicit_autorefs` error
7. **GitHub Actions approach is fundamentally limited** by Solana compilation issues
8. **Docker approach fails** due to same compilation problems
9. **Pre-built environments are more reliable** than compiling from source
10. **SSL/TLS connection issues** prevent Solana installation in CI/CD environments
11. **GitHub release URLs** for Solana binaries are often incorrect or missing
12. **Docker image authentication** requirements block access to pre-built images
13. **Toolchain version conflicts** are pervasive across all approaches
14. **The Solana ecosystem is fundamentally broken** for Windows development
15. **Every single approach we tried has failed** due to different but related issues

## Files Created
- `spin_wheel/` - Main Anchor project
- `spin_wheel/programs/spin_wheel/src/lib.rs` - Solana program code
- `spin_wheel/tests/spin_wheel.ts` - Test suite
- `spin_wheel/Anchor.toml` - Anchor configuration
- `spin_wheel/Dockerfile` - Docker build configuration (deleted)
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow (9 failed attempts)
- `download-build.ps1` - PowerShell script to download artifacts
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - This troubleshooting log

## Summary
**Total approaches tried: 15+**
**Total failures: 15+**
**Success rate: 0%**

The Solana development ecosystem appears to be fundamentally incompatible with Windows development workflows, with every single approach failing due to different but related issues including toolchain conflicts, SSL problems, authentication requirements, and compilation errors.
