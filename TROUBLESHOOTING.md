# WOLF-SPIN Troubleshooting Log

## Problem Summary
We need to build a Solana program (spin wheel DApp) on Windows, but Solana programs require Linux ELF format (`.so` files) while Windows produces DLL format (`.dll` files).

## What We've Tried and Why It Failed

### 1. Local Installation Approach
**What we tried:** Installing Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor locally in the project folder
**Why it failed:** 
- Windows/bash incompatibility issues
- Network issues with `Invoke-WebRequest`
- PowerShell script encoding/parsing errors

### 2. Global Installation Approach
**What we tried:** Installing Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor globally
**Why it failed:**
- `cargo build-sbf` command not available (Solana toolchain not properly installed)
- `anchor build` produces Windows DLL instead of Linux ELF
- Solana CLI doesn't have a direct build command

### 3. Docker Approach
**What we tried:** Using Docker to build in Linux environment
**Why it failed:**
- First attempt: Custom Dockerfile with manual Solana installation failed due to network issues
- Second attempt: Using pre-built Anchor Docker image failed due to authentication requirements
- Third attempt: Using rust:1.90.0-slim with manual installation failed due to `cargo build-sbf` not available

### 4. WSL2 Approach
**What we tried:** Using WSL2 Ubuntu to build in Linux environment
**Why it failed:**
- WSL commands hanging when trying to execute from PowerShell
- Interactive sessions not returning properly
- Couldn't establish proper communication with WSL environment

### 5. Cargo Installation from Source
**What we tried:** Installing Solana CLI and tools via `cargo install --git`
**Why it failed:**
- Yanked dependencies (`solana_rbpf = "=0.8.0"` is yanked)
- Compilation errors due to missing dependencies
- Version conflicts between different Solana packages

### 6. Pre-built Binary Installation
**What we tried:** Downloading and running Solana installer executable
**Why it failed:**
- Symlink creation requires administrator privileges
- Windows permission issues with creating symlinks
- Installer expects specific directory structure

### 7. Toolchain Version Conflicts
**What we tried:** Using `cargo build-sbf` and `anchor build` with pre-built binaries
**Why it failed:**
- `cargo build-sbf` forces use of rustc 1.72.0-dev instead of installed 1.90.0
- `anchor build` has same toolchain override issue
- `Xargo.toml` file causes toolchain conflicts
- Cargo.lock version 4 incompatibility with current Cargo version
- Even `cargo +stable build-sbf` doesn't work due to internal toolchain override

## Current Status
- ✅ Rust 1.90.0 installed and working
- ✅ Solana CLI 1.18.4 installed and working (from pre-built binaries)
- ✅ Anchor CLI 0.31.1 installed and working
- ✅ `cargo build-sbf` command available and working
- ✅ Program compiles successfully on Windows (produces DLL)
- ❌ `cargo build-sbf` fails with toolchain version conflicts (rustc 1.72.0-dev vs 1.90.0)
- ❌ `anchor build` fails with same toolchain version conflicts
- ❌ `Xargo.toml` file causes toolchain override issues
- ❌ Cargo.lock version 4 incompatibility with current Cargo version

## Next Steps to Try

### Option 1: GitHub Actions Build (RECOMMENDED)
- Use GitHub Actions to build in Linux environment
- Download built `.so` file locally
- Deploy using `anchor deploy`
- This is the most reliable approach for Windows development

### Option 2: Use Online Solana Development Environment
- Use Gitpod, CodeSandbox, or similar with Solana tooling
- Build in cloud Linux environment

### Option 3: Proper WSL2 Setup
- Manually set up WSL2 with Ubuntu
- Install Solana toolchain inside WSL2
- Build from within WSL2 environment

### Option 4: Manual Binary Download and Installation
- Download pre-built Solana binaries directly from GitHub releases
- Extract to a local directory
- Add to PATH manually
- This should include the `cargo build-sbf` command

## Key Learnings
1. Solana programs MUST be built for Linux ELF format, not Windows DLL
2. The `cargo build-sbf` command is essential for Solana program building
3. Yanked dependencies in the Solana ecosystem cause compilation failures
4. Windows symlink permissions can block installer execution
5. WSL2 communication from PowerShell can be problematic
